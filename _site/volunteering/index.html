<p>The charity is now run by four trustees. These are:

    Cee, our founder and visionary who works alongside our volunteers daily, giving essentials and food packs to the homeless, creating relationships that have to be seen to be understood.
    
    Toni, originally from Yorkshire, joined PINT during lockdown as an outreach volunteer. A true animal lover, Toni aspired to help the many homeless people and their pets that she encountered, by giving as much support as possible through outreach campaigns. Shocked by the amount of homelessness during the pandemic, and inspired by the organisation, Toni brought PINT to the North of England, helping to increase the support available to those in need.
    
    Anwar, a widely known figure in today's boxing world, and a former homeless person supported by PINT, joined the charity as an organiser and participant. Having lost his way of life and career due to a life changing illness, the support that PINT gave Anwar was massively appreciated, and he uses his connections with many of those he has befriended on the streets of London to help shape the organisation.
    
    Charlotte Devaney, our ambassador and voice when it matters. A bubbly and vibrant individual working relentlessly on her career as a DJ and artist, who always finds time for those in need. Like Toni, Charlotte is a huge animal lover, whose concern ensures that our four legged friends on the streets gain the love they need as well as their owners.
    
    Lastly, not to be forgotten are our volunteers whose efforts allow our work to continue. Whether through outreach, a one-off visit, or a regular spot at our soup kitchen, each one plays a vital role in our little army, tackling homelessness one day at a time.
    
    Special thanks to: Marya, Yashar, Dionne, Richard, Donna, Nayna, Gary, Tush, Chris, Ruvini, and all the others who make it happen. We are always looking for reliable individuals who can give up a few hours of their time to volunteer with us. There are many roles to choose from, whether volunteering on the streets with our outreach team, or helping with the charityâ€™s administration, legal, marketing, or graphic design departments. An email is all it takes to find out how you can make a difference to someone in need today. To find out more or to volunteer, contact us @EMAIL ADDRESS
