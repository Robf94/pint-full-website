            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>One of our key principles as an organisation is outreach work. Twice a day, our volunteers go out into UK cities, seeking out those sleeping rough, and provide them with various supplies. The packages assembled by our volunteers range from hot meals, snacks, and water, to essentials including wet wipes, toothbrushes, socks, and underwear. We perform these outreaches, making sure that those on the streets know that we are coming, and that support will soon be with them.</p>
            <p>Another aspect of our work is providing aid for those locally in Westminster, Wandsworth, And Lambeth. When we are able to, we also provide emergency assistance. We provide regular support to the elderly and vulnerable confined to their homes by bringing them food parcels. Every week we help between 600-700 people of various ages, ethnicities, and genders.</p>

            <h2>Street and community work</h2>
            <p>Our work, from its humble beginnings, extends to many young teens and adults on the streets with mentorship and help toward steering them in the right direction.</p>
            <p>As advocates for young people, we believe in providing them with the confidence to seek out and create opportunities. Whether musical interest, sporting, or even business ideas, we always try to support individuals in achieving their ambitions.</p>
