"I am passionate about the fight to end homelessness and feel lucky to be part of the team at PINT. I'm with likeminded people who are helping others and making a positive impact to lives everyday."

Anwar

"When I was suffering it was difficult for me mentally and physically. Sometimes, you want to give up, but then you see there is much more to life. An organisation like PINT made a big difference in my life, I felt compelled to join them and help make a difference towards others in their lives."

Derek

"I volunteer with PINT because it is important to help people in need. Too often, they are regarded as faceless bundles of clothes in doorways. Each person deserves dignity and respect, everyone has a story and an inner life. We provide more than food, we are good listeners and want to engage, to give people space to talk. I value this very much and look forward to seeing our friends every Wednesday and Friday."

"My religion teaches me that what matters most in life is the good deeds you do on earth and the legacy you leave behind. Also, there is much misconception out there about the homeless and needy and someone needs to correct that!"
