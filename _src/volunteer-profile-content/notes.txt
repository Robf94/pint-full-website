volunteer-pages.json file notes

The "layout" key sets each markdown page to have the volunteer-profile.njk layout. This avoids having to type this in each .md file and helps with consistency and error reduction.

The "permalink" key specifies the URL structure for the generated output HTML page. The "/{{ page.fileSlug }}/" is the value assigned to the permalink key. Broken down:
    - "/" forward slash, used as a separator in URLs
    - "{{ page.fileSlug }}" is a placeholder enclosed in double curly braces. When 11ty processes the content file, it replaces this placeholder with the slugified* version of the content file's filename (excluding fil etension). The slugification process typicalyy converts spaces to hyphens and makes the filesname lowercase.
    - "/" closes the URL structure

*Slugification - the process of converting a string into a URL-friendly format
