<h2>{{ pageTitle }}</h2>

<p>One of our key principles as an organisation is outreach work. Twice a day, our volunteers go out into UK cities, seeking out those sleeping rough, and providing them with various supplies. The packages assembled by our volunteers range from hot meals, snacks, and water, to essentials including wet wipes, toothbrushes, socks and underwear. Daily throughout the year, we perform these outreaches, making sure that those on the streets know that we are coming, and that support will soon be with them.

    Another aspect of our work is providing aid for those locally in Westminster, Wandsworth, and Lambeth. When we are able to, we also provide emergency assistance, and regularly support the elderly and vulnerable confined to their homes by bringing them food parcels. Every week we help between 600 - 700 people of various ages, ethnicities and genders.

    <p>vision - As a charity our vision is to help those on the streets, providing essentials to see them through the day and night, whether it be food, a blanket or a sleeping bag. Our power comes from our reliability and consistency, our regular outreaches, and the relationships this fosters between ourselves and the homeless. By getting to know homeless people, we help to rebuild the hope and connection needed to get them living better, more fulfilling lives.

      Seeing the impact of our work firsthand, we aim to extend the outreach of People In Need Today (PINT) throughout the UK.
