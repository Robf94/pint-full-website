      <p>
        The groundwork for PINT (People In Need Today) began in 2006, with a group of music industry
        professionals searching for new talent in deprived parts of South London. This included
        council estates where Cee, who later founded PINT, encountered an alarming amount of
        homelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unwilling to ignore this issue, what started as a quest for talent evolved, and, pulling
        together resources and industry contacts, Cee began donating food and other supplies
        directly to the homeless. Before long, the people Cee helped began pointing out others in
        need, illuminating a huge crisis. Seeing the scope of action needed, Cee continued devoting
        his time and energy to helping the homeless, and seventeen years later, PINT is now a fully
        registered charity (1199209), providing support and mentoring to those who need it most.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        As a charity our vision is to help those on the streets, providing essentials to see them
        through the day and night, whether it be food, a blanket or a sleeping bag. Our power comes
        from our reliability and consistency, our regular outreaches, and the relationships this
        fosters between ourselves and the homeless. By getting to know homeless people, we help to
        rebuild the hope and connection needed to get them living better, more fulfilling lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing the impact of our work firsthand, we aim to extend the outreach of People In Need
        Today (PINT) throughout the UK.
