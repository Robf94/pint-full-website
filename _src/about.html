<p>The groundwork for PINT (People In Need Today) began in 2006, with a group of music industry professionals searching for new talent in deprived parts of South London. This included council estates where Cee, who later founded PINT, encountered an alarming amount of homelessness. Unwilling to ignore this issue, what started as a quest for talent evolved, and, pulling together resources and industry contacts, Cee began donating food and other supplies directly to the homeless. Before long, the people Cee helped began pointing out others in need, illuminating a huge crisis. Seeing the scope of action needed, Cee continued devoting his time and energy to helping the homeless, and seventeen years later, PINT is now a fully registered charity (1199209), providing support and mentoring to those who need it most.</p>
